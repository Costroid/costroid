# Style

Every public line in this repository, code or prose, meets this bar.

## Prose

- Write short declarative sentences, one idea per paragraph.
- Leave out filler, hype, emoji, exclamation marks and marketing adjectives. Words such as "seamlessly", "robust", "powerful", "comprehensive", "leverage", "delve", "streamline" and "unlock" are rejected.
- Do not end a section with a summary of it. Do not apologise or hedge.
- Give every number its unit and, where it can change, its date. Link every claim about accuracy or performance to its measurement.

## Documentation

- A README says what the project is, why it exists, how to install it and what the first command shows.
- Every example runs in CI as a test.
- Write one page per task, not one per feature.
- A comparison with another project states facts with dates and links, never adjectives.

## Code

- Go code passes `gofmt`, `go vet` and `staticcheck` with zero findings.
- No generated boilerplate comments, no comments that restate the code, no TODO or FIXME on the main branch, no dead or commented-out code, no placeholder names and no copied blocks.
- Functions are small enough to read whole.
- Errors carry context and are never swallowed.
- A test name states what the test proves.

## History

- Commit messages use the imperative mood and say what changed and why.
- Release notes are written for users, grouped by what they can now do, with breaking changes first.
