CI rejects a pull request with an unsigned commit. Contributions are licensed under Apache-2.0, the licence of this repository.

## Changing the repository

1. Install Go 1.27, staticcheck and Docker. `make check` starts Postgres in Docker.
2. Make the change.
3. Run `make check`. It must exit 0.
4. Read [STYLE.md](STYLE.md). It is the bar for every public line.
5. Open a pull request with three sections: changed, deliberately unchanged, verified.

Commit messages use the imperative mood and say what changed and why.
